After installing the app use 'npm run dev' to run it. (not 'npm start').

The app will launch on http://localhost:3000

Some of the things it uses:
Redux
Redux Saga
Centralized Prop Types
Selectors
Cached API responses
Styled Components (not sure if I like it yet, also need to eject to be able to get readable class names)
